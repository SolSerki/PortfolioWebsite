{`A  loud creak of old wooden floors echoed through the dark hall as Billy stepped into the abandoned house.
—Ah, great! So much for sneaking around. — said Mike — Now the hobos know we’re here.
— It’s called abandoned for a reason, dipshit, jeez!
— Hey! You’re the dipshit, dipshit”.
—Nah uh, You just want an excuse not to enter, cause you’re a chicken.
— Am not!
— Prove it, go up those stairs
Mike looked into the hall till his eyes adjusted to the thick darkness. Only thin filaments of light filtered from the boarded windows while dust danced to the aerie tune of utter silence.
In front of them, there was a tall, ornate staircase leading to the second floor. The baluster was decorated with webs, and the twenty three steps up looked ash-pale as if covered by dust of ages.
— No way! It’s gross, and Mum will kill us if we come back dirty
—That’s what a chicken would say — replied Billy with a smug.
Mike rolled his eyes and pushed his brother out of the way. The dusty boards complained, and Mike walked on tiptoes to avoid as much noise as possible. It wasn’t effective. The wood was bent and eaten inside out, splintered and decayed.
The house was old. Very old. Ancient. It was the very first house built in the town, oh so many years ago.
Billy said he found it exploring the outer skirts. A whole neighbourhood of abandoned houses, left to rot. This baffled Mike. Why would anyone leave their homes like that?
Mike rolled down his sleeves, to avoid touching anything with his hands. He arrived at the bottom of the stairs and looked up, they looked fragile and endless, one strong wind away before it crumbled to splinters. Mike swallowed and took heart. If he succeeded, he would have the upper hand with his elder brother, a rare occasion.
He took the first step, and of course, the stair replied with a small squeak. Then another, and another. He grabbed the handrail with the cloth of his sleeve which was already brown with dust.
« If the stairs don’t kill me, mum certainly will » he thought as he reached step number six.
—C’mooon, hurry up! What if the hobos wake up and eat you — said Billy leaning forward in the door’s frame.
— Shup up! I’m going!
Billy always seemed to be the one instigating adventure, but he rarely ventured inwards. He just stood there and watched as his young brother faced the most creepy, dusty and old staircase anyone has ever seen.
Mike kept pushing upwards, step by step, squeak by squeak. The spiders remained still, waiting, just waiting. Mike swallowed, as he reached half way the staircase. He now could see the second floor. Then he froze.
He saw footsteps in the dust. Someone had been there. Recently. 
His shaking hand grasped the railway. He didn’t want to make a noise, what if they were still here? There weren’t any other footsteps. 
He looked back at Billy, and his spine injected ice to his vein when he didn’t see him at all. 
« He left! He abandoned me! How could he leave me here?» he thought as his eyes were pooling tears.
Then, he heard something upstairs. The little hair in the back of his neck filled with static. It was whining, someone crying. A boy perhaps. 
It sounded so familiar though. The crying of a scared, wounded boy.
— He- hello? — he muttered. No reply. The muffled weeping continued. 
« Maybe someone came before us and got injured, we should help » he thought.
Mike had always had a soft spot for helping people. He couldn't leave someone in this God forsaken place. He looked back one more time, and Billy still wasn’t there.
Mike took heart, and continued upwards. Worst case scenario, he would just rush down the stairs and leave forever.
— Hello? Is someone there? — he said as he reached the top of the stairs. A long dark corridor was in front of him, with a single door at the end. Now he could hear more clearly, someone was crying. But there was something very strange about that sound. It sounded so familiar, like he heard it before.
He approached the door, his heart pumping so hard it almost pushed out of his chest. He opened the door.
The room was pitch black, only a single thread of light was passing through the frame of the door. It smelled putrid, like someone had used it like a bathroom and never used a toilet. 
Mike couldn’t believe his eyes. With ragged clothes, and pieces of flesh missing, like someone took a bite, Billy was cowering in the corner, crying.
— Billy? How the hell… — mumbled Mike.
Billy looked at him, eyes sore, red. His face dirty and hands bloody. His clothes were stained with blood and puke and feces. He looked at Mike in horror, he pointed back at him, handshaking.
Mike heard the deafening scratch of the floor right behind him, as a hand, so big, sticky, with sharp pointy claws, pushed him in the room, and slammed the door close.`}
