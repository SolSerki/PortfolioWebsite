# Personal Portfolio (React + Node + Tailwind + Anime.js)

This is a starter for your personal portfolio:
- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind + Anime.js
- Backend: Node.js + Express + TypeScript

## Getting Started

1) Install dependencies
- Open two terminals or use your editor's workspace
- In /client and /server run:
  npm install

2) Run dev servers
- In /server:
  npm run dev
- In /client:
  npm run dev
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:4000

The frontend dev server proxies API calls to the backend during development.
